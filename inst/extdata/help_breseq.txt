                                   (mixed) mutations. Setting this flag changes
                                   from CONSENSUS MODE (the default) to
                                   POLYMORPHISM MODE
  -x,--nanopore                    Set options for nanopore data. Equivalent to

                                   "". If you provide any of these options on their
                                   own, then they will override these preset
                                   options.

Read File Options
  -l,--limit-fold-coverage <arg>   Analyze a subset of the input FASTQ sequencing
                                   reads with enough bases to provide this
                                   theoretical coverage of the reference sequences.
                                   A value between 60 and 120 will usually speed up
                                   the analysis with no loss in sensitivity for
                                   clonal samples. The actual coverage achieved
                                   will be somewhat less because not all reads will
                                   map (DEFAULT=OFF)
  --aligned-sam                    Input files are aligned SAM files, rather than
                                   FASTQ files. Junction prediction steps will be
                                   skipped. Be aware that breseq assumes: (1) Your
                                   SAM file is sorted such that all alignments for
                                   a given read are on consecutive lines. You can
                                   use 'samtools sort -n' if you are not sure that
                                   this is true for the output of your alignment
                                   program. (2) You EITHER have alignment scores as
                                   additional SAM fields with the form 'AS:i:n',
                                   where n is a positive integer and higher values
                                   indicate a better alignment OR it defaults to
                                   calculating an alignment score that is equal to
                                   the number of bases in the read minus the number
                                   of inserted bases, deleted bases, and soft
                                   clipped bases in the alignment to the reference.
                                   The default highly penalizes split-read matches
                                   (with CIGAR strings such as M35D303M65).
  --read-min-length <arg>          Reads in the input FASTQ file that are shorter
                                   than this length will be ignored. (0 = OFF)
                                   (DEFAULT=18)
  --read-max-same-base-fraction <arg>                                              
                                   Reads in the input FASTQ file in which this
                                   fraction or more of the bases are the same will
                                   be ignored. (0 = OFF) (DEFAULT=0.9)
  --read-max-N-fraction <arg>      Reads in the input FASTQ file in which this
                                   fraction or more of the bases are uncalled as N
                                   will be ignored. (0 = OFF) (DEFAULT=0.5)
  --long-read-trigger-length <arg> Mark a file as containing long reads and enable
                                   read splitting if the longest read has a length
                                   that is greater than or equal to this value. (0
                                   = OFF) (DEFAULT=1000)
  --long-read-split-length <arg>   Split input reads in a file marked as having
                                   long reads into pieces that are at most this
                                   many bases long. Using values much larger than
                                   the default for this parameter will likely
                                   degrade the speed and accuracy of breseq because
                                   of how it performs mapping and analyzes
                                   split-read alignments. Filters such as
                                   --read-min-length are applied to split reads. (0
                                   = OFF) (DEFAULT=200)
  --long-read-distribute-remainder When splitting long reads, divide them into
                                   equal pieces that are less than the split
                                   length. If this option is not chosen (the
                                   default), reads will be split into chunks with
                                   exactly the split length and any remaining bases
                                   after the last chunk will be ignored.
  --genbank-field-for-seq-id <arg> Which GenBank header field will be used to
                                   assign sequence IDs. Valid choices are LOCUS,
                                   ACCESSION, and VERSION. The default is to check
                                   those fields, in that order, for the first one
                                   that exists. If you override the default, you
                                   will need to use the converted reference file
                                   (data/reference.gff) for further breseq and
                                   gdtools operations on breseq output!
                                   (DEFAULT=AUTOMATIC)

Reference File Options
  -c,--contig-reference <arg>      File containing reference sequences in GenBank,
                                   GFF3, or FASTA format. The same coverage
                                   distribution will be fit to all of the reference
                                   sequences in this file simultaneously. This is
                                   appropriate when they are all contigs from a
                                   genome that should be present with the same copy
                                   number. Use of this option will improve
                                   performance when there are many contigs and
                                   especially when some are very short (â‰¤1,000
                                   bases). (DEFAULT=0)
  -s,--junction-only-reference <arg>                                               
                                   File containing reference sequences in GenBank,
                                   GFF3, or FASTA format. These references are only
                                   used for calling junctions with other reference
                                   sequences. An example of appropriate usage is
                                   including a transposon sequence not present in a
                                   reference genome. Option may be provided
                                   multiple times for multiple files. (DEFAULT=0)
  -t,--targeted-sequencing         Reference sequences were targeted for ultra-deep
                                   sequencing (using pull-downs or amplicons). Do
                                   not fit coverage distribution.
  --user-evidence-gd <arg>         User supplied Genome Diff file of JC and/or RA
                                   evidence items. The breseq output will report
                                   the support for these sequence changes even if
                                   they do not pass the normal filters for calling
                                   mutations in this sample.

Read Alignment Options
  -m,--minimum-mapping-quality <arg>                                               
                                   Ignore alignments with less than this mapping
                                   quality (MQ) when calling mutations. MQ scores
                                   are equal to -10log10(P), where P is the
                                   probability that the best alignment is not to
                                   the correct location in the reference genome.
                                   The range of MQ scores returned by bowtie2 is 0
                                   to 255. (DEFAULT=0)
  -b,--base-quality-cutoff <arg>   Ignore bases with quality scores lower than this
                                   value (DEFAULT=3)
  --quality-score-trim             Trim the ends of reads past any base with a
                                   quality score below --base-quality-score-cutoff.
  --require-match-length <arg>     Only consider alignments that cover this many
                                   bases of a read (DEFAULT=0)
  --require-match-fraction <arg>   Only consider alignments that cover this
                                   fraction of a read (DEFAULT=0.9)
  --maximum-read-mismatches <arg>  Don't consider reads with this many or more
                                   bases or indels that are different from the
                                   reference sequence. Unaligned bases at the end
                                   of a read also count as mismatches. Unaligned
                                   bases at the beginning of the read do NOT count
                                   as mismatches. (DEFAULT=OFF)
  --deletion-coverage-propagation-cutoff <arg>                                     
                                   Value for coverage above which deletions are
                                   cutoff. 0 = calculated from coverage
                                   distribution (DEFAULT=0)
  --deletion-coverage-seed-cutoff <arg>                                            
                                   Value for coverage below which deletions are
                                   seeded (DEFAULT=0)

Bowtie2 Mapping/Alignment Options
  --bowtie2-scoring <arg>          All calls to bowtie2 must use the same commands
                                   for assigning scores to read alignments. Larger
                                   scores are assumed to be better by breseq. Each
                                   call to bowtie2 has this option added to its
                                   command line. (DEFAULT="--ma 1 --mp 3 --np 0
                                   --rdg 2,3 --rfg 2,3 --ignore-quals")
  --bowtie2-stage1 <arg>           Settings for mapping criteria used for the stage
                                   1 alignment. This step is normally meant for
                                   quickly aligning near-perfect matches.
                                   (DEFAULT="--local -i S,1,0.25 --score-min
                                   L,1,0.9 -k 2000")
  --bowtie2-stage2 <arg>           Settings for mapping criteria used for the stage
                                   2 alignment. If set to the empty string "", then
                                   stage 2 alignment is skipped. This step is
                                   normally meant for exhaustively mapping reads
                                   that were unmapped by stage 1. (DEFAULT="--local
                                   -i S,1,0.25 --score-min L,6,0.2 -k 2000")
  --bowtie2-junction <arg>         Settings for mapping criteria used in aligning
                                   reads to candidate junctions. (DEFAULT="--local
                                   -i S,1,0.25 --score-min L,1,0.70 -k 2000")
In addition to these values, breseq automatically sets the seed size for bowtie2 read mapping (-L option) to a value that is scaled to the read length (r). This value is 0.5 * r for stage 1, 5 + 0.1 * r for stage 2, and 0.3 * r for junction mapping. In each case, it is bounded to the range [4,31] as required by bowtie2. Be warned that breseq internally rescores alignments with a scoring scheme setting +1 for match, -3 for mismatch, -2 for gap open, and -3 for gap extend for consistency when comparing alternative alignments present in the bowtie2 output.

Junction (JC) Evidence Options
  --no-junction-prediction         Do not predict new sequence junctions

                                   more bases. Indel mutations of this length or
                                   longer will be predicted by JC evidence and
                                   those that are shorter will be predicted from RA

  --junction-alignment-pair-limit <arg>                                            
                                   Only consider this many passed alignment pairs
                                   when creating candidate junction sequences (0 =
